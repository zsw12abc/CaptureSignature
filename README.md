# CaptureSignature
This is an iOS app to capture the signature.

##Description
In this app, users can draw their signatures in different colors(draw view), save to local device(core data) and send them 
to my email box.

##Tech skill
this app is based on Swift 2.0 coding by Xcode 7.0.
I used Navigation Controller and Tab Bar Controller to allow user choose different functions.
I also used core data to store all the signatures in the local device and use the tableview to display these signatures to users.
they also can sort the signatures based on name.
